	* Release 1.04

2003-01-31  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c (plx905x_module_init): Corrected PCI9030 detection.
	Local configuration register area was tested for the wrong size.  The
	correct size is 128 (as for PCI9050), not 256 (as for PCI9054).  As a
	result, a test has been added to distinguish PCI9030 from PCI9050 and
	PCI9052 and various bits of code have been moved around.  Also, the
	PCI9052 is now reported as revision 1, rather than revision 2.

	* README: Updated as PCI9030 has now been tested.  Also, the 'plx'
	module parameter no longer needs to be set for the PCI9030 to be
	distinguished from other supported chips.

	* Release 1.03

2002-11-13  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* README: Removed a redundant (and misleading) paragraph.

2002-10-31  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c (plx905x_module_init): Added check for PLX PCI9060ES
	and PCI9060DS.  Relaxed the check for PCI9060 when the 'plx' parameter
	is used, as the PCI9060 sometimes has 0 in its hardware ID register.
	N.B. support for PCI9060 is still untested.

	* Release 1.02

2002-10-28  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c: Added a module parameter 'plx' to specify the type
	of PLX chip manually.  This affects the device type to search for when
	the vendor and device IDs are not specified, and is also checked
	against fixed register values for certain PLX chips.

	* plx905x_main.c: Added provisional support for PLX PCI9030.  The new
	'plx' module parameter must be used.  This is untested.

	* README: Updated documentation to reflect the above changes.

2002-10-25  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* Release 1.01

2002-10-25  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c: Added provisional support for PLX PCI9056, PCI9060,
        PCI9080 and PCI9656.  This is untested.

        * plx905x_main.c: Added a module parameter 'eeprom' to specify the
        size of serial EEPROM fitted.  The default EEPROM size for the PCI9054
	is 256 bytes.

	* plx905x_main.c: Check revision of PLX chip. Fail if not supported.
	Report assumed PLX model and revision.

        * README: Updated documentation to reflect the above changes.

2002-10-25  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c: Added copyright, licensing and contact information.

	* Makefile: ditto.

        * README: ditto.

2002-10-24  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx905x_main.c: Renamed plx9050_main.c.  Changed name of module
	to plx905x.

	* Makefile: Changes due to renamed files and module.

        * README: New file.  Main documentation.

2002-10-08  Ian Abbott  <ian.abbott@mev.co.uk>

	* plx9050_main.c: Added support for PLX PCI9054.
