## Note that the file dkms.conf is somewhat ephemeral.  It is included
## within the distribution tar file, but gets recreated from the
## dkms.conf.in file by ./configure, and gets removed by 'make distclean'.
## It would be nice if there was a simple way to create the files at
## "maintainer" level, rather than at the "configure" level, then they
## would stick around after a 'make distclean'.

## From automake documentation:
## Note that EXTRA_DIST can only handle files in the current
## directory; files in other directories will cause make dist runtime
## failures.
