Version 2.1.4 2025-04-07
=============

Fix Makefile to allow building for kernel version 6.15-rc.


Version 2.1.3 2024-12-03
=============

Update detection of separate kernel source and build directories for
kernel version 6.13-rc.

Do not run depmod during make install if $(DESTDIR) is set.

Fix a few GCC compiler warnings.


Version 2.1.2 2023-09-11
=============

Improves detection of separate kernel source and build directories.


Version 2.1.1 2023-05-11
=============

Kernel compatibility fixes for kernel version 6.4.


Version 2.1 2021-03-19
===========

Adds fixes for PLX PCI9056.  Corrects the code for detecting PLX PCI9056
and PCI9656.  It did not work because it treated the BAR 0 size of 512
as invalid for the supported PLX chips.  Corrects the code for accessing
the serial EEPROM contents for PLX PCI9056 to be the same as that for
the PCI9656.  Reading and writing EEPROM contents works for PCI9056 now.


Version 2.0.1 2020-10-18
=============

Kernel compatibility fixes for kernel version 5.6 to 5.9.


Version 2.0 2019-04-10
===========

Major revamp for building on modern kernels, and to make use of
SysFS/UDEV or DevFS for creating the "/dev/plx905x" file automatically
for non-static "/dev".

Now uses a ./configure script and Makefiles generated by Autotools.


Version 1.04 2003-01-31
============

Corrects detection of PLX PCI9030 which has now been tested.  The 'plx'
module parameter no longer needs to be set to distinguish the PCI9030
from other supported chips.  The PCI9052 is now reported as revision 1
rather than revision 2.


Version 1.03 2002-11-13
============

Adds check for PLX PCI9060ES and PCI9060DS.  Relaxes the check for
PCI9060 when the 'plx' parameter is used, as the PCI9060 sometimes has 0
in its hardware ID register.  Support for PCI9060 is still untested.


Version 1.02 2002-10-28
============

Adds a module parameter 'plx' to specify the type of PLX chip manually.
This affects the device type to search for when the vendor and device
IDs are not specified, and is also checked against fixed register values
for certain PLX chips.

Adds provisional support for PLX PCI9030.  The new 'plx' module
parameter must be used.  This is untested.


Version 1.01 2002-10-25
============

Supports PLX PCI9050, PCI9052, PCI9054.  Has provisional support for PLX
PCI9056, PCI9060, PCI9080 and PCI9656, but those are untested.
